/* 
Arithmetic operators
    Addition -> a + b

    Subtraction -> a - b
    
    Multiplication -> a * b
    
    Division -> a / b
    
    Exponent -> a ** b -> 2 ** 4 = 16
    
    Modulo -> a % b -> 4 % 3 = 1 (4 divide by 3 - remainder is 1) | 4 % 10 = 4 (remainder is 4 because we were not successful in dividing 4 by 10)
    
    Increment and Decrement -> increase or decrease a value by 1 -> Let a = 5, a++ gives a = 6, a-- gives a = 5 because previous value of a was 6.

/*
Comparison operators and equality
    returns true or false
    const a = 5, b = 10
    a > b -> false
    a < b -> true
    10 < 10 -> false
    10 <= 10 -> true
    10 == 10 -> true
    5 != 10 -> true -> 5 is not equal to 10

    Strict equality
    a === b
    Strict inequality
    a !== b

    5 == "5" -> true - loose equality
    5 === "5" -> false -> strict equality

    Strict equality === -> compares values and data types and return true on both true

    Loose equality == -> compares only values, doesn't compare data types

    The good ones : === !==
    The bad ones : == != (avoid using)
